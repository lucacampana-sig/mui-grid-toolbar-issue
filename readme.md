This repository shows a bug encountered while using the material UI x data grid pro

To run this:

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

A full page grid will be displayed, when the "density" and "export" buttons are clicked, a menu shows up, when that menu is closed (clicking anywhere) it will appear for a fraction of second under the grid
